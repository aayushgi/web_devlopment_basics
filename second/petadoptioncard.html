        <h1>Meet jeery</h1>
        <p>Jeery is a playful bundle of energy, always running around with his floppy ears bouncing and his tail wagging
            like a little drumbeat. He has a habit of tilting his head whenever someone talks to him, as if he
            completely understands every word. Mischievous at times, Jeery loves stealing socks and hiding them in the
            most unexpected places, yet his innocent eyes always save him from scolding</p>

        <h1>Meet tom</h1>
        <p>e cat is a quiet observer, often found perched by the window, watching the world with sharp, unblinking eyes.
            She moves with grace, as if every step is carefully planned, and her soft purrs fill the room whenever she
            decides to curl up on your lap. Independent yet affectionate, she carries an air of mystery that makes her
            presence feel magical</p>
